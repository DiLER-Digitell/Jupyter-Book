# Course overview & procedure

Now that you've got an idea what this website is about, let's discuss how we'll hopefully get your course up and running. The following document will therefore clarify the structure and general setup of this course.

The course is divided into several modules, each covering a step in the creation of your course. The modules include content creation, how to structure your course "book", as well as how to host your course website using github. You can simply start from the beginning and work your way down through all respective sections. If you're already familiar with the concepts of **GitHub**, and the **Jupyter Framework**, the [Quick Set-Up](./10min.ipynb) may also be a good place to start.
The following section will illustrate the structure of the contents contained.

#### Objectives üìç

You can use the following links to navigate through the content of the course:

[Setup](./setup/setup.ipynb)

We'll need to get some software to start off with this course! 

[Introduction/Why JB-Notebooks](./intro/whyjb.ipynb)

All things gotta start somewhere, but how and why?


[Content creation](./tutorialcontent/writing.ipynb)

Here you'll learn how to create and style content, such as the pages displayed on this website!

- [What's a Jupyter Notebook?](.tutorialcontent/writing/cells)
- [Styling: The Look and Feel](./tutorialcontent/writing/styling)
- [Embedding Media: Images, Videos and more](./tutorialcontent/writing/media)
- [Creating automatically gradable coding assignments](./tutorialcontent/writing/nbgrader)

[Structuring content](./tutorialcontent/structure)

How do we structure our course website?

[Publishing](./tutorialcontent/publishing/publishing)
- [Build and publish your course](./tutorialcontent/publishing/account)

[Troubleshooting](./tutorialcontent/troubleshooting)
Encounter any problems? Check-out common sources of errors and their possible solution.

[Example Courses](./intro/demo)

[Quick Set-Up](./10min.ipynb)
If you already know some basics and want a refresher on how to quickly write, build and host a course. 

[Ressources](./ressources/info)

Some things to help you implement a starting point for promoting a safe and productive course environment. 

- [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/questionnaires.html)
    What to look out for, what to keep in mind and how to trear each other.
- [Code of Conduct](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/CoC.html)
    Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning experience.
- [Open Science](./openscience/openscience)
    Ressources on how to implement open science practices in research or introduce students to the idea of open science

#### How do I get all the software and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Everything we'll use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or at minimum free of charge and publicly available. 
`*Why?*` Because teaching via [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is just not fair and doesn't align with our values (see our open science statement). We don't want we people to have to obtain licenses or be dependent on universitiy ressources or pay for software/hosting etc. oit of their own pocket. Additionally, [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) can do everything, if not more than [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) and is furthermore usually better supported, tested and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community. 

In order to help you get all the software required for the course, a [comprehensive installation instruction](./setup/setup.ipynb) was compiled. In a step-by-step manner it guides you through the installation process, covering several `OS`: `windows`, `macos` and `linux`. Now the installation of the required packages probably goes beyond the scope of how most people engage with their computers on a daily basis, therefore errors and following frustration may occur.
 **Please do not be discouraged! If any problems occur during the installation process, please feel free to contact us (or the google) and we'll get that sorted out**


#### Where is everything?

All course materials will be available on this very course website. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are **free to explore, enhance and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up ideally to end of the internet, but will possibly be subject to changes and updates. If you feel the need to save this ressource as it is at the moment you're reading this, you can download the complete course from our github repo [here]. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.

We will also be providing a [course template](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler) that will serve as a tool for our practical examples and can be downoladed [here](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). The template contains a folder structure, some example content files, as well as a license, open science statement, an equity, diversity and inclusion statement, as well as a code of conduct for your course.
This template is supposed to be used as a starting point to generate your own course. Simply add your content or adapt the preexisting ressources, adapt the structure to your liking, upload the whole thing into an online github repository and you're course website will be created automatically.



#### How to reach the content creators


If you have:

**Questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so you could use the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin, on the right-hand side of this website (overlayed over the scroll bar, you'll find some [symbols looking like this]() [embedd png]()) to annotate and highlight relevant information of this website Feel free to use this tool to discuss, annotate or ask questions regarding the sites content there!

Otherwise feel free to [Open an issue]() on the Github repository and someone will try and get back to you as soon as possible or simply shoot us an e-mail!
